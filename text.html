<h1>IMPORTANCE OF ART AND GRAPHICS IN ARCHITECTURE</h1>
<p>Art and graphics is basically a visual art expressed on a flat surface. It includes the knowledge of color wheel along with its application, fundamental architectural elements and forms, geometric solids, forms, tonal values , perspective drawing etc. It also uses the modern computer aided techniques.
    Architecture is also an art, a field of creativity and imagination so art and graphics has a deep relation with it.
    Since, we are learning this subject we need to know why we are learning it. So following are the importance of art and graphics:
    <br> <br>
    1.	Medium of communication:
    <br>
    Art and graphics uses text, pictures and gifs to represent anything. Especially in architecture, it’s very important to convey the design value and meaning which can be done conveniently with art and graphics. It not only makes the design understandable but also makes it impressive. It gives a clean and proper touch to the design. The concept and stories behind any design or creation can be conveyed very easily with the visual expression of art and graphics.
    It helps to convince the client about the merits of the design. Client can also tell about their needs. It helps the building contractor to move the plan on paper to the actual site.
    <br>
    
    2.	Teaching learning process:
    <br>
    Learning the architecture is all about learning designs, forms, geometry, and principles. With the use of art and graphics it becomes very easy because students can relate to the real world of architecture. The picture use is very efficient for learning process.
    <br>
    3.	Presentational ideas for architectural drawing:
    <br>
    Architectural drawing includes elevation, plans, views, sections etc. It can be very boring and dead to see those but with art and graphics it makes them lively. It gives a touch of real world to the drawing that makes it relatable for all. With it, we even don’t have to show dimensions because the proportion makes it all clear. Human, trees, vehicles, are the elements making elevations real. 
    Presentational drawings like floor plans, elevations, site plan, sections, shadow construction, perspective drawing are very important. All these things are included in art and graphics. These drawings are core element for any presentation.
    <br> 
    4.	A need in this global world:
    <br>
    As we are living in the 21st century everything is one touch way. So now choices, preferences and requirements have moved up to a new level. To fulfill them art and graphics can be really feasible option for architects. We cannot just be a designer but the best one for our client. There can be lot more options, thus we need to really know the skill of art and graphics.
    The use of art and graphics helps to establish professionalism. Its use in every presentation builds quite a good relation with clients. In architecture relations with client are integral part.
    
    <br>
    
    5.	A junction point of various subjects:
    <br>
    Be it design or drafting or free hand sketching, art and graphics sum them all. It is great advantage as it helps us to compile everything and present it as one. Color theory (Color scheme, color wheel), compositions (texture, trees, human, and vehicles), tonal values (bright, dull tone, high, medium, dark), are directly related with freehand sketching. Elements and forms (point, line, plane, solids, geometric forms), building design forms are the parts of design subject. Elevations, sections, site plan, floor plan, relates to the drafting. 
    Thus, art and graphics is the combination of a lot of things which develops new ideas about of architecture. Especially for beginners like us this subject can be a boon. We learnt some things in first semester, this subject helps to use all those things.
    <br>
    6.	A tool to establish individuality:
    <br>
    Since we have already mentioned art and graphics as a strong means of communication. After we complete a design the use of art and graphics makes it clean, attractive and real. How a design comes out really depends on the use of art and graphics, that’s where the individuality is built. It kind of works as professional brand. The color use, compositions, element and form use, rendering skills really depends upon the individual. All these things make every individual and their creations unique. 
    <br>
    7.	Innovative element:
    <br>
    Architecture is a very dynamic field that requires a lot of creativity and innovation. Art and graphics always aids us to grow our creative potential. Architects are responsible to design new spaces with a good concept that not only fulfills aesthetic value but also functional value that requires a lot of innovation. Art and graphics can motivate for bringing best out of our artistic skills. With such element we can create such things that nobody has even thought of. In this modern tech world it is a boon to have new things.
    <br>
    8.	Rendering skills for decision making:
    <br>
    Rendering is the technique of generating photorealistic or non-photo realistic image from a 2d or 3d model. Architecture requires a good rendering skills because real life like experience of proposed architectural design is essential. To know how the space and design will work before the actual building have been built rendered images are needed. It helps to experiment with building designs and its visual aspects. Thus, it helps to make design related decisions before actual building is built. If any mistake is there, it can be corrected. Decision is really very important for architects.
    Rendering is important aspect of art and graphics. It teaches the rendering in Architectural building both exterior and interior. That is essential skill for architects.
    <br>
    9.	2D and 3D Compositions:
    <br>
    The visual appearance of any design depends on the organization of its elements. It is very important to have a clear view of architectural elements on paper in 2d or 3d. Art and graphics makes it easier through the principles of art. Line, point, volume, geometric forms, solids are the elements of architectural drawing. They need to be organized properly for a clear understanding. Art and graphics teaches us the compositions.
    <br>
    <br>
    So the above mentioned points are the importance of art and graphics which I could relate to. These are my perception about art and graphics.
